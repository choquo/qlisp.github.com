            <p>Html5 History API provides a way to maintain history of the current session.
               This information can be used for page navigations. It will really come handy
               when you are using AJAX to load pages and want to have browser navigation
               (back/forward) active. Here we will simulate an AJAX like behavior, with
               sections acting like pages. Consider it to be like retreiving JSON data and
               dynamically adding them to DOM. Using Html5 History API, we will maintain the
               history and use it for navigating back and forth using browser's navigation
               button. We will use 'hashchange' event and hashtags for urls.
            </p>
            <p>
               Before proceeding, it would be better if you have some idea on how jQuery works
               because, we'll use jQuery for DOM manipulation. However, I'll give a brief
               introduction to jQuery in the next page.
            </p>
            <p>
               Note that this example doesn't use AJAX. It simulates that behavior. For making
               AJAX requests you need a server to which the webpage will sent requests using
               XMLHttpRequest (XHR) and the server will respond by sending data preferably in
               XML or JSON format.

        <section id="two">
            <h5 class="ph">Page 2</h5>
            <p>This is a brief introduction to jQuery and its usage. jQuery is mainly used for
               DOM manipulation. We will use jQuery's ready() method. You listen for the ready
               event and once the DOM elements are ready to be manipulated, you proceed with the code.
               The general syntax is like <code>$(document).ready(callbackFunction);</code>
            </p>
            <p>
               We can use anonymous function and the code will now look more familiar        
<pre>$(document).ready(function () {
    //all you code will go here..
});</pre>
                You can select an element with an id similar to the way you use CSS selectors.<br/>
                <code>var myElem = $('#myElemId')</code> will make the 'myElem' variable hold
                the html element with id 'myElemId'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now jQuery is out of the way, we can focus on page navigation.

        <section id="three">
            <h5 class="ph">Page 3</h5>
            <p>As you can see that this tutorial itself works based on the Html5 history APIs.
               Now let's focus on the core ideas behind page navigation and history. To navigate
               using the browser's default navigation buttons, i.e, by using the back and forward
               buttons, there must be a change in the URL. The navigation buttons get active only
               if the URL of the current window (page) changes. When we use AJAX (JSON), the URL
               of the current window doesn't change. So we won't have any active navigation, which
               implies, no history as well. That's where the History API comes to our rescue. When
               we make an AJAX call or when we show some page change, we'll add a new hashtag to
               the current URL using 'pushState' function. This will append a hashtag to the
               current URL, but won't navigate to that URL.
            </p>
            <p>
               To add hash to the URL without causing the page navigation, we'll use
               <code>window.history.pushState(null, "", "#hashtag")</code> method. We need to be
               concerned mainly about the third parameter, which is the hashtag string. After that
               we'll trigger a 'hashchange' event <code>$(this).trigger("hashchange");</code>.
               We'll listen for that event, and when it gets captured, we can get the current hash
               value from <code>window.location.hash</code> and do the necessary action, like
               populating contents, hiding elements etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next we'll discuss history API methods in more detail.

            <h5 class="ph">Page 4</h5>
            <p>
                These are some of the notable functions in the history API.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><code>window.history.pushState(data, title, url)</code></strong><br/><br/>
                
                <code>@param data</code><br/>
                data is generally something that is specific to the context of the particular page.
                Say in the first page you retreive data in JSON format. Say our data is:
<pre>{
    page: '1',
    title: "Tutorial",
    category: "Html5",
    desc: "intro"
}</pre>                
                This is specific to the first page. So when we want to navigate to another page
                we can save that data so that the next time when we revisit popstate will fire
                and the you can retreive the data through event.originalEvent.state object.<br/><br/>                
                
                <code>@param title</code><br/>
                The second parameter can be any string.<br/><br/>                
                
                <code>@param url</code><br/>
                Can be hashtag or a string. Note that you can't change the baseURI,
                or it will throw SECURITY_ERR exception. Otherwise it will be easy for URL spoofing.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p>                
                <strong style="color: lightGreen;">The 'popstate' event</strong><br/>
                When you navigate in history, popstate will be fired, and the data correspoding to
                the state will be popped. Theses data objects are kept in a stack using the pushState
                function explained above.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><code>window.location.hash</code></strong><br/>
                This variable will contain the current hashtag of the window
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong style="color: lightGreen;">The 'hashchange' event</strong><br/>
                'hashchange' event is will be fired whenever there is a change in navigation, i.e
                if you travel back and forth in history, each time the hashchange event will be fired.
                So we can listen for the hashchange event and do the necessary action. We don't have
                a specific way to know whether the user has clicked the back or forward button. We detect
                it using the hashchange and infer from it. Since we already listen for the hashchange event,
                we'll trigger the event when the user clicks the page anchor link to go to next page. Otherwise,
                we can have a separate way to deal with clicking links as opposed to clicking back/forward buttons,
                which isn't really necessary. So that's the reason we trigger 'hashchange' event manually.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><code>window.history.replaceState(data, title, url)</code></strong><br/>
                This function is same as that of push state. But instead of pushing a new state
                to the stack, it will replace the top state (from the stack) with the one specified
                in this function.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><code>window.history.forward()</code></strong> will go one step forward in history and
                <stong><code>window.history.backward()</code></strong> will go one step backward in history. We
                are not using these methods in this tutorial.
